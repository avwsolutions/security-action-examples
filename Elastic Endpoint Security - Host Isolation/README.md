This action will isolate a host running Elastic Agent with the Endpoint Security integration enabled.

**Please note** - In most situations, we would not recommend automatically isolating hosts. Please use this as an example with caution and discretion. If you would like to implement this as an automated action, be sure that it is part of your wider operational procedures to do so.

The webhook URL should look similar to:

`https://<kibana-url>/api/endpoint/isolate`
